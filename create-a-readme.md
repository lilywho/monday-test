#Creating Your First README.md file

Every GitHub respository should be initialized with a README.md file.  This Markdown file will be the main source of documentation for many open source projects on GitHub.  It often contains instructions and an overview of the project.  Tonight, you'll create your first README.md using the Markdown syntax and push it to YOUR GitHub repo.  

	TIDBIT: Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
